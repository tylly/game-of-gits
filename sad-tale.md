House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned messed around and found out, and he got killed by like, a twelve year old or something. That's what happens when you get into other peoples business.
